# Hello World
This is my home page! My name is Abram Felicilda and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/)and my major is ## Electrical Engineering
My Github page is http://github.com/Abram1777.
### CPSC 120 
* Lab 1
    First lab was pretty memorable for me because it gave me the sense of how the environment of this class would work. Downloading and booting up coding systems on a school borrowed computer was not something I ever saw myself doing.

* Lab 3
    Lab 3 was my favorite because both my classmate and I were clueless on the topic and computer science as a whole. We both struggled and learned how to code the BMR of people using their weight, height, age, and gender.

* Lab 7
    This lab, I was lucky enough to be partnered with someone who's major was actually computer science so he was able to teach me while not slowing down on the work either. He and I were able to code how parking times work when it comes to specifying, the time and days of the week when and when not to park.
